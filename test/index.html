        <p>Galapagos Islands’ giant tortoises and green sea turtles face many threats such as deforestation, habitat
            destruction, pollution, climate change, introduced species, diseases and, above all, illegal trafficking. <br><br>

            The Shellsea Project focuses on performing sanitary evaluations to identify, treat, and contain any diseases
            our turtles might carry; preserving their health; recovering species that have been victims of illegal
            trafficking; and raising awareness among the authorities, institutions, and the local population so that
            they take appropriate measures. It is hard work, but hard does not mean impossible!<br><br>

            In recent decades, several instances of illegal trafficking involving Galapagos’ tortoises and turtles have
            been documented and exposed by local and international media. Many of these species are threatened with
            extinction due to exploitation, leaving a current population size of only 10-15% of their historical
            numbers. A total of fifteen Galapagos giant tortoises are endemic to the archipelago, six of them being
            critically endangered and three currently extinct. Our foundation, which has been supporting the Galapagos
            National Park for more than three years, currently works closely with authorities to devise strategic
            approaches to increase security and monitoring efforts around turtle nesting sites to prevent further
            trafficking attempts.
